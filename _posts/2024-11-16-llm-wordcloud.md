excerpt: A word cloud of key concepts crucial to understanding LLMs. 
---

I have [Oreilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/) subscription. There has been a sudden influx of books, videos, and other learning material on LLM and AI. To improve my understanding of AI & LLM, I have shortlisted following books - 

* [How AI Works](https://nostarch.com/how-ai-works) by Ronald T. Kneusel
* [Build a Large Language Model From Scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka

This word cloud shows the important technical terms I've learned about large language models (LLMs). To truly understand how LLMs work, you need to know these terms. I'm studying each one and will explain the most important ones in detail in subsequent post. These are the building blocks of LLM language.
