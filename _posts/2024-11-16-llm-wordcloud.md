excerpt: A word cloud of key concepts crucial to understanding LLMs. 
---

I have [Oreilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/) subscription. There has been a sudden influx of books, videos, and other learning material on LLM and AI. To improve my understanding of AI & LLM, I have shortlisted following books - 

* [How AI Works](https://nostarch.com/how-ai-works) by Ronald T. Kneusel
* [Build a Large Language Model From Scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka

This word cloud visualizes the technical terms I've come across while reading about LLMs. To gain a deep understanding of how LLMs function, it's essential to familiarize oneself with these concepts. I'm systematically exploring each term, and I intend to create in-depth explanations for some of the most important ones. These terms form the foundation of the LLM language, its fundamental vocabulary.
